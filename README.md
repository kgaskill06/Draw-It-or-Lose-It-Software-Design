# Draw-It-or-Lose-It-Software-Design

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room was the client that was seeking to expand their web-based game of Draw It or Lose It!, which is currently only on an Android, to multiple platforms. There will be 4 rounds where two teams compete in guessing a drawing that draws over 30 second time frame. Each team would have multiple players assigned to it and the game and teams must be unique. The player would need to have the ability to check and see if a name was taken. They wanted unique identifiers made so only one game instance could exist in memory.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I felt I was able to give a great explanation for each recommended solution and the reasoning behind it. With proper research of the market and their given solutions, I was able to identify efficient solutions to the client's requests. In my assignment journal before, I mapped out a well executed idea of the path I needed to take with this overrall solution which prevented more extensive work. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Best part of working through the design document was the UML diagram when developing the code. It gave me a visual understanding of how the application to the standards of the client's needs. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would want to be more specific on my Project 2 of the development tools documentation. I felt the rubric was too vague and the context of how I took the answer should be completed was incorrect and thus caused my scoring of points to be significantly lower. I felt with the feedback of the instructor, I was able to get the picture of how it should be rrrrrranswered correctly. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I intrepeted the user's needs by my understanding of how a game platform should operate from a user's standpoint by the experiences I have had with other gaming platforms. By understanding what a consumer would expect, I was able to take the client's needs and frame them in a way that would be beneficial for the user experience. Having to rely less on the development standpoint of what the client's user's hardware constraints may be or how quickly something loads is critical for a successful program launch. User need's are the most vital needs to consider. The users are what makes a game successful. If a user does not find the experience favorable or enjoyable, they are less likely to continue to play, which lowers the activity of the game. Less activity would mean lesser players, longer wait times, and overall less fun. You have to always try and design the software around what would be enjoyable and quality of life additions for a design concept. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I first approached it with what were the client's outlines around the game. I used this to create a mental frame of what must be done. Everything in between was used to create software that would be scalable and as close to future proof as possible. Reviewing the patterns, the singleton pattern was by far a great technique to discover and implement. I would need to approach any future software designs around how I created the backend client that allowed limits to game sessions being created as well as the REST archtecitural pattern in creating a client-server. Considering how the game structure should be implemented, these techniques will help me with an approach that would be effective in future projects.
